# Dog breed prediction

- In this project, We have used tensorflow and keras to build train and test an InceptionV3 network to predict dog breed.


## Steps to build project

1. Load the dataset from Kaggle. ***IMPORTANT*** [Download Data set from Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset) 
2. Checking the breed count.
3. ONT-HOT Encoding on lables data PREDIC.TION column.
4. Load the images, Convert them to an array & normalize them.
5. Check the shape and size of the X and Y Data.
6. Building the model Network Architecture using InceptionV3
7. Split the data and fir it into the model and create new accuracy point.
8. Evaluate the model for accuracy score.
9. Using the model for prediction.
10. Building User Interface using Gradio Framework


## Steps to run the project
1. Go to the executable file .
2. Download the Dog Breed Classification.h5 model.
3. Give path to the load model where you have downloaded the model.
4. Run the cells of executable file in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Open the link which is displayed as final output.
6. Upload the image from your device and submit it to know the breed.

Now you can see the results.
## NOTE: If you have Ananconda installed then you will not need requirements.txt because anaconda comes will preinstalled packages

## NOTE: This project will take about 1 hour to run depending on your computer
